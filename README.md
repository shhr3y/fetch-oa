* All code is in Swift
* UITableView is used to display all information.
* Extension.swift may contain lot of unnecessary code as its collection of lot of helpful functions that came in use during my past projects.
* Main.Storyboard was deleted, all my projects have their UI designed programmatically.
* Check for internet connection was not added as it wasn't asked and would have made OA complex unnecessarily.
* MVC architecture is used. MVVM could have been used but didn't seem necessary due to less no. of files.
* no external libraries were used.
